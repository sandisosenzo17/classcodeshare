ClassCodeShare

ðŸ“– Project Overview

ClassCodeShare is a classroom engagement app that allows a host (lecturer/tutor) to create live coding sessions where guests (students) can submit code snippets in response to tasks. Lecturers/tutors emphasize student engagement in class during coding classes but unfortunately not all students have access to laptops/PCs. This application enables them to answer coding questions and engage using any device they have as long as there's internet connection.

- Location-based participation ensures only students near the host can join.
- Students can write and run code via an external code execution API.
- Hosts can store session history, tasks, and student submissions for grading or future review.


âœ¨ Features

- User Roles: Host (educator) & Guest (student).

- Session Management: Hosts can create/join/close live sessions.

- Tasks: Hosts assign coding tasks with optional deadlines.

- Code Submissions: Students submit code snippets per task.

- Location Capture: Ensures engagement from nearby learners.

- Session History: Hosts may choose to keep logs of tasks & submissions.

- Activity Log: Tracks important actions (session joined, task submitted, etc.).

- External Code Execution API (optional): Run snippets inside the app.
